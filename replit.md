# İslami Okul Yönetim Sistemi

## Overview

This is a comprehensive weekend Islamic school management system built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application provides role-based access control for administrators, teachers, and parents to manage students, classes, lesson plans, attendance, progress tracking, and behavioral notes.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Authentication**: Custom session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **API Design**: RESTful API with role-based route protection
- **Request Handling**: JSON middleware with CORS support

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless connection
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon serverless connection pooling

## Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses express-session with PostgreSQL store
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for password hashing and verification
- **Role-based Access Control**: Three roles (ADMIN, TEACHER, PARENT) with specific permissions
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication and authorization checks

### Data Models
- **Users**: Admin, teacher, and parent accounts with role-based permissions
- **Students**: Student profiles with firstName, lastName, enrollmentDate (kayıt tarihi) linked to classes and parents
- **Classes**: Class management with program type associations
- **Program Types**: Three types - Haftasonu (Weekend), Yatılı (Boarding), Yetişkin (Adult)
- **Lesson Plans**: Weekly curriculum planning with page assignments
- **Progress Tracking**: Student progress with color-coded performance indicators (90%+ green, 50-89% yellow, <50% red)
- **Attendance**: Three status types - geldi (present), gelmedi (absent), mazeretli (excused)
- **Behavior**: Weekly behavioral notes and comments

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with tablet and desktop optimizations
- **Turkish Localization**: Complete Turkish language interface
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive UI component system based on Radix UI
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Progress Visualization**: Color-coded progress bars and status indicators
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Desktop sidebar can be collapsed/expanded for better screen real estate

## Recent Changes

### July 31, 2025
- **Fixed Attendance System**: Resolved all 400 errors and foreign key constraint violations in attendance API
- **Enhanced Attendance Features**: Added late arrival and early departure options with time tracking and notes
- **Streamlined Attendance Interface**: Removed card-based boxes and simplified to clean list format per user request
- **Database Schema Updates**: Added arrival_time, departure_time, and notes fields to attendance table
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Successfully tested all attendance statuses (geldi, gec_geldi, erken_cikti, mazeretli, gelmedi)

### January 30, 2025
- **Fixed Login System**: Resolved frontend authentication issues where error handling was conflicting with API request function
- **Simplified Lesson Plans Page**: Removed add/edit functionality per user request, keeping only list view with week filtering
- **Fixed Progress Page Student Display**: Corrected field mapping from `student.name` to `student.firstName + student.lastName` to match database schema
- **Fixed TypeScript Issues**: Resolved Set iteration and field mapping errors across admin and teacher interfaces

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials against database
3. Session is created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. User is redirected to role-appropriate dashboard
5. Subsequent requests include session authentication

### Data Management Flow
1. Frontend makes API requests using TanStack Query
2. Express middleware validates session and role permissions
3. Drizzle ORM handles database operations
4. Response data is cached and displayed in React components
5. Optimistic updates provide immediate user feedback

### Progress Tracking Flow
1. Teachers input weekly progress and attendance data for individual students
2. System calculates progress percentages based on lesson plans
3. Color-coded indicators provide visual feedback
4. Parents can view their child's progress in real-time
5. Administrators can monitor overall class performance
