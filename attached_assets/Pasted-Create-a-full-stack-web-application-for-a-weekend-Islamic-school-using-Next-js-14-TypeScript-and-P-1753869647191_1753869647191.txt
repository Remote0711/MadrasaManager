Create a full-stack web application for a weekend Islamic school using Next.js 14 + TypeScript and Prisma with PostgreSQL.  
The user interface (labels, titles, buttons, placeholders, error messages) must be entirely in Turkish.

---

1. Authentication:
- Use NextAuth (credentials provider)
- Roles: ADMIN, TEACHER, PARENT
- Route protection with role-based guards

---

2. Prisma data models:
- User (name, email, password, role)
- Parent (linked to User + Student)
- Class (name, level)
- Student (firstname, lastname, class, attendance, progress, behavior)
- LessonPlan (week, subject, pagesFrom/to, classLevel, programType)
- ProgramType (e.g. "Haftasonu", "Yatılı", "Yetişkin") ← NEW
- Progress (pagesDone vs. planned)
- Attendance (with categorized reason: geldi, gelmedi, mazeretli)
- Behavior (weekly comments)

---

3. Seed script:
- 2 admins, 3 teachers, 6 parents
- 6 classes (T1a–T3b)
- 60 students
- 3 ProgramTypes: "Haftasonu", "Yatılı", "Yetişkin"
- LessonPlans for 10 weeks assigned to each ProgramType

---

4. File structure:
prisma/schema.prisma  
src/pages/index.tsx  
src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts  
src/pages/dashboard/admin/  
src/pages/dashboard/teacher/  
src/pages/dashboard/parent/  
src/lib/prisma.ts

src/lib/ai.ts (placeholder for `generateReport(studentId)`)  
src/components/Layout.tsx  
src/i18n/tr.json  
public/logo.svg  

---

5. Features:
- Admin Dashboard: manage users, classes, lesson plans, assign program types
- Teacher Dashboard: weekly progress input, attendance, behavior tracking, AI Report button (disabled)
- Parent Dashboard: see child's progress and attendance
- Auto calculation: % of lesson plan fulfilled → progress bar (green ≥ 90 %, yellow 50–89 %, red < 50 %)

---

6. Responsive UI: Tailwind CSS for mobile, tablet, and laptop

---

7. .replit:
entrypoint = "src/pages/index.tsx"  
run = "npm run dev"

---

8. README.md:
- Setup steps: install, prisma db push, dev
- Explain Turkish-only UI and how to extend ProgramTypes
